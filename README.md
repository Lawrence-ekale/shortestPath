# shortestPath
In the program there are input files which are used to test and you can provide yours.
The rules are as follow:
i) The program reads the input from the file.
ii) We are trying to find the shortest path from the start of the file to the end of the file.
iii) The files contain names of cities or countries.
iv) The names are one per line.
v) The last character of the name should be the starting character of another name.
vi) There should be a path from the start of the file to the end.e.g if first city/country is france then,
the next name should be a city/country starting with character "e". So options are like "egypt" or another name.
vii) If the last file name is "nairobi" then there should be a path from france to nairobi else we output 0 meaning deadend.
viii) If there are multiple ways  then we output the shortest path.
